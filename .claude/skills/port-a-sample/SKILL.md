# Porting recipe — how a port is built

Part of the ai-demokit rulebook: `AGENTS.md` (always read first) defines
mission, scope, layout and the sidecar contract; this guide is the
**authoritative long form of the generation recipe**. When it changes in
substance, update `scripts/generation-prompt.txt` in the same change
(AGENTS.md "Generation prompt"). For the recurring hard idioms and the worked
reference ports see the `idiom-lookup` guide next to this one.

### App skeleton — how a port is built

This is the complete recipe for turning one UI5 demo kit sample into a port.
Follow it exactly so every port looks the same and stays maintainable.

**Inputs** — the sample's original files from the OpenUI5 checkout: the
`*.view.xml` (the UI), the controller (`*.controller.js` — event handlers),
`Component.js` / `manifest.json` (which model data is loaded), plus any local
`*.json` mock data. All of these are also copied verbatim into the sample's
`ui5/<library>/<SampleName>/` folder (AGENTS.md §4).

**Output** — one class `z2ui5_cl_smpc_app_<n>` implementing `z2ui5_if_app`, whose
view is a **1:1** rebuild of the sample's XML.

#### Class layout

```abap
CLASS z2ui5_cl_smpc_app_<n> DEFINITION PUBLIC.       " lowercase, not FINAL

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES z2ui5_if_app.
    " local types for the model data (ty_s_ / ty_t_) + the DATA that back the
    " bindings live here, so the framework can serialise them across round-trips
    TYPES:
      BEGIN OF ty_s_item,
        ...
      END OF ty_s_item.          " `TYPES:` alone, then BEGIN OF - never `TYPES: BEGIN OF` on one line (pattern-lint types-layout)
    DATA t_items TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ty_s_item WITH EMPTY KEY.
    " names carry no Hungarian prefix (lv_/iv_/lt_/ls_/rv_/…, pattern-lint hungarian-prefix): only a
    " table is t_ and a structure s_; a boolean predicate such as is_copy is a name, not a prefix
    " ONLY bound DATA belongs in PUBLIC: the round-trip model scan walks the
    " public instance attributes, so every non-bound helper/backup kept here
    " just slows the binding search. Put such state in PROTECTED (see below);
    " pattern-lint's unbound-public-attribute fails a public DATA no binding
    " reaches (38 of them sat in 23 ports until the 2026-09-11 sweep).

  PROTECTED SECTION.
    DATA client TYPE REF TO z2ui5_if_client.
    METHODS view_display.
    METHODS on_event.        " only if the app reacts to events
    METHODS model_init.      " only if the app has model data - declared LAST

  PRIVATE SECTION.           " always present, kept empty
ENDCLASS.
```

#### `z2ui5_if_app~main` — the dispatcher

```abap
METHOD z2ui5_if_app~main.

  me->client = client.
  IF client->check_on_init( ).
    model_init( ).
    view_display( ).
  ELSEIF client->check_on_navigated( ).
    view_display( ).
  ELSEIF client->check_on_event( ).
    on_event( ).
  ENDIF.

ENDMETHOD.
```

- **Method order in the implementation**: `z2ui5_if_app~main` is always the
  **first** method; the remaining methods follow **in the order they are
  called from `main`**, depth-first (`view_display` → `on_event` → helpers
  right after their caller) — **except `model_init`, which always goes LAST**,
  after every other method (and is declared last in the DEFINITION too). It
  usually holds a large `VALUE #( )` block of mock data; keeping it at the
  bottom stops that data from interrupting the reading flow of the dispatcher,
  view and event methods. pattern-lint checks that main comes first and that
  model_init comes last. **The DEFINITION declares the methods in that same
  order** — the declaration block is the table of contents of the
  implementation (51 classes declared them in another order until the
  2026-09-12 sweep).
- A sample with **nothing to seed** drops the `check_on_init( )` branch
  altogether, and a **fully static** one (no data, no events — app 051's class)
  drops `on_event` with it, down to:

  ```abap
  me->client = client.
  IF client->check_on_navigated( ).
    view_display( ).
  ENDIF.
  ```

- `check_on_init( )` fires once when the app instance starts — seed the data
  there, and **nothing else**. It is not a display branch: it being true implies
  `check_on_navigated( )` is true (every path to a first `main( )` sets that
  flag — `factory_first_start` for a fresh start and for a draft restore,
  `factory_system_startup`, `prepare_app_stack` for call and leave), so an init
  branch whose only statement is `view_display( )` decides nothing, and
  `IF check_on_init( ) OR check_on_navigated( ).` is the same redundancy in
  another spelling. `pattern-lint`'s `redundant-init-display` fails both.
- `check_on_event( )` fires on every user interaction — dispatch in `on_event( )`.
- `check_on_navigated( )` fires on the first start AND whenever the app *regains*
  the screen — it is where `view_display( )` lives, in every port.
- Add `model_init( )` / `on_event( )` **only when the app actually has data /
  events** — never a pass-through method with a single statement. A static app
  (like app 051) has just `view_display( )` in each of its two display
  branches. A
  **data-less-but-stateful** app (its only "model" is one or two control-state
  flags a button toggles, e.g. `expanded`) seeds those flags **inline in `main`**
  (or `view_display`), no `model_init` — the single-statement-method rule wins
  (app 128 precedent).
- **A scalar literal → two-way binding is faithful, not a structural difference.**
  Turning `expanded="false"` into `expanded="{/EXPANDED}"` to reproduce a
  controller's imperative `setExpanded` is the idiomatic thin-frontend move;
  `structural-diff` does **not** flag it (it compares control/attr presence, and
  binding *values* only where the original itself binds). Declare a `LIVE_TEST`
  only because the round-trip *behaviour* is unverified, not because the diff
  requires it (app 128/172 precedent).
- **The `check_on_navigated( )` branch is unconditional, not "if the sample
  navigates".** `check_on_init( )` means "this app instance never ran" — it
  stays false when the overview app is re-entered, when a `z2ui5_cl_pop_*`
  value help hands control back (those run over `nav_app_call` too), and when a
  bookmarked state is restored. Those roundtrips fire `check_on_navigated( )`
  alone: without the branch the browser keeps showing the *previous* app's
  view, silently. A port that only ever runs standalone looks fine and breaks
  the day it is opened from a navigation — which is exactly how the overview
  app opens every port. Most of the existing corpus predates this rule; new and
  touched ports get the branch.

#### `model_init` — the model

The sample's JSON model becomes ABAP: one `ty_s_`/`ty_t_` type per JSON array,
filled with `VALUE #( ( … ) ( … ) )`. Field names are the JSON keys, upper-cased
by ABAP; bindings reference them in braces (`{TITLE}`, `{PRODUCTID}`). **A
camelCase key mirrors verbatim — do not insert underscores**: `SupplierName` →
field `suppliername`, binding `{SUPPLIERNAME}` (never `SUPPLIER_NAME`) — a corpus
convention. (structural-diff would tolerate either — its `normBind` lower-cases
**and** strips underscores — so this is for consistency, not to satisfy the
gate. The corpus was migrated to it on 2026-09-12 — 71 classes, the worked
references 022/040 among them, so `productid`/`suppliername` is what you will
copy; a port-invented helper field with no original key, `weight_state` or
`start_at`, keeps its own name.)
Keep the
data verbatim from the sample — **the full row set, no subsetting**: inline every
row of the referenced mock array (e.g. all 123 `/ProductCollection` rows of
`ui5/mock/products.json`), byte-identical to the mock (`SUBSET_DATA` is no longer
an accepted deviation — user decision). **Rows, not columns:** per row, inline
only the fields the view actually binds (the 040/022 practice — unbound mock
keys stay out of the row type); "full row set" never means all 20 JSON keys of
every row. Where the original itself binds a single record
(`{/ProductCollection/0}`) or a precomputed stats array
(`/ProductCollectionStats/Filters`), reproduce exactly that — that is the 1:1
data, not a shortening. A packed field must carry enough `DECIMALS` for the mock
(e.g. `Price` has 2-decimal values, so `TYPE p … DECIMALS 2`).

**Line the columns up.** A mock table of three or more rows with the same field
list is written as a table: every cell padded to the width of its column, the
LAST cell of a row left unpadded so no spaces pile up before the closing `)`.
`node scripts/json-to-abap.mjs` emits exactly that, so a generated block needs
no touching; `pattern-lint`'s `ragged-value-table` catches a hand-written one
that drifted.

```abap
t_fixed_navigation = VALUE #(
    ( title = `Fixed Item 1` icon = `sap-icon://employee` enabled = abap_true )
    ( title = `Fixed Item 2` icon = `sap-icon://building` enabled = abap_true )
    ( title = `Fixed Item 3` icon = `sap-icon://card`     enabled = abap_true ) ).
```

Two exceptions, both of them real:

- **A padded row that would break the 255-character limit is wrapped instead** —
  at the SAME field boundaries in every row, so the columns still read down the
  page. App 571 is the reference: 123 rows, every one of them `3+4+4` (identity /
  dimensions / weight+price). The wrapped rows are **not** padded inside their
  groups — that is 571's shape, and padding a wrapped block is what carried
  apps 012/218/358 past the 75,000-character `statement-too-long` budget on
  2026-09-12 (`line-headroom` warns at 240, both pattern-lint).
- **Rows whose field list differs are left alone.** Where one row carries a
  `key` and the next does not, or some rows nest a child table
  (app 585's `t_navigation`), there is no column to align — that is different
  data, not sloppiness.

**abap2UI5 serves a single default model — there are no named models.** A sample
that binds against a named model (`img>/products/pic1`, a separate `JSONModel`,
`sap/ui/demo/mock/*.json`) must be **flattened** into the one default model:
merge the extra model's fields into the row type, or — for pure display assets
like image URLs that are the same for every row — inline them as literals /
build them from a shared base (a non-bound `base_url` kept in `PROTECTED`, not
`PUBLIC`, so the round-trip model scan stays small).
**Deviation type for the flattening:** a **pure prefix-drop that renders
identically** — same data, same leaf name, `structural-diff` 0 diffs
(`{ui>/rowMode}`→`{/ROWMODE}`, `{img>/products/pic1}`→`{/PIC1}` with the real
value) — is faithful → **`NOTE`**. Use **`IMPROVISED`** only when the fold
actually *loses or changes* something: drops bound columns, resolves a live
model statically, or substitutes values with ones the original never shows.
A URL that is merely re-HOSTED is not a substitution: app 006 folds
`img>/products/pic1..3` to the mock's own values on sdk.openui5.org and
therefore renders identically, which is why its sidecar types that fold as a
`NOTE` — this guide cited it as *the* `IMPROVISED` example until 2026-08-21,
contradicting the rule in the sentence above it and guaranteeing that every
review sweep would re-find the disagreement. When
binding a single record the original `bindElement`s (`/SupplierCollection/0`),
seed those fields at the **default-model root** — and then bind them
**absolutely** (`client->_bind( suppliername )`), *not* with the original's
relative `{SupplierName}`: without the element binding there is no context for
a relative path to resolve against (see the flattened-element-binding trap
below; the linter rule is `relative-binding-without-context`). Seed the
**actual mock row-0 values**,
verified against the mock, not a neighbour port (app 162/142 had copied wrong
values). Worked examples: app 006 (`sap.m.Carousel`, `img>` → the mock's own
values, re-hosted — a `NOTE`); app 175 (`SimpleForm`, supplier row-0 flatten).

**Absent JSON properties must not become empty strings.** A flat ABAP row
serializes every field on every row; where the original JSON simply omits a
property, the port sends `""` — and UI5 rejects `""` on **enum**-typed
properties (`validateProperty` throws where the original's `undefined`
picked the default) and overrides non-empty property **defaults** (e.g.
`Link.target` `_blank`). Fill the UI5 default value explicitly in the ABAP
data, or split the aggregation into per-shape templates (the QuickView port's
`QuickViewGroupElementType`/`AvatarShape` crashed every page this way).

**It takes the whole VIEW down, not the row**, and the miss is usually a single
row: `validateProperty` throws *inside a binding update*, which
`ManagedObjectBindingSupport` re-throws. The corpus sweep measured it —
*"3,285 row-build sites across 128 (port, table) pairs examined, 10 defects in 6
ports"* — and the shape to expect is 536's and 538's: **one** model row, out of
46 and out of 37, without the field. A sibling row, or a sibling port, that does
seed it is no evidence the row beside it does — and fixing one enum on a row does
not fix the one next to it: 549's `type` was seeded by a linter rule that could
not see the `aria` omission on the same INSERT, and 547 had the `aria` half of
the identical pair fixed while the `type` half was not.

**Read the default out of the UI5 source, and do not take it from the property
next to it.** `CalendarAppointment.ariaHasPopup` defaults to `None`
(`CalendarAppointment.js:120`), but `type` defaults to **`Type01`**, inherited
from `DateTypeRange.js:43` — `CalendarAppointment` does not override it. App 546
was once seeded `type = None` beside a comment saying the original "falls back
to the property default": `None` is *`secondaryType`*'s default, so the port
rendered a different colour from the original and nothing failed.

The **boolean** case is the quiet one: `abap_bool` has no absent state either,
so an unset field serializes as a real JSON `false` and OVERRIDES a control
default of `true`. Nothing crashes — the control simply renders the opposite of
the sample. App 291's notification items lost their close button that way, and
with it the port's only backend wire, because there was nothing left to press.
Check every boolean the mock does **not** carry against the control's
`defaultValue`, remembering it is usually declared on a BASE class
(`showCloseButton` lives on `NotificationListBase`, not on the
`NotificationListItem` the view names).
`scripts/probes/absent-boolean-probe.mjs` scans the corpus for it.

#### `view_display` — the view via `z2ui5_cl_ui5_view_builder`

Build the view with the generic builder **`z2ui5_cl_ui5_view_builder`**. The class lives
in abap2UI5 core (`src/02/`, migrated from this repo) and resolves through the
abap2UI5 abaplint dependency. It translates a
UI5 XML view 1:1 by method chaining — every control, property and namespace maps
directly, nothing is approximated. The navigation verbs are short so the `)->`
arrows line up:

| Verb | XML meaning | Tree action | Returns |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `ele( n ns )` | open a container tag `<X>` | add child **and descend** into it | the new child |
| `tag( n ns )` | a self-closing tag `<X/>` | add child, **stay** on current node | the same node |
| `end( )` | the closing `</X>` | **ascend** to the parent | the parent |
| `a( n v )` | one `name="value"` | add an attribute to the control just added | the same node |

Arguments: `n` = tag name, `ns` = namespace **prefix** (literal `f`, `l`, `core`,
`mvc` — omitted for the default `sap.m` namespace). The prefix is the corpus'
**canonical** one for that namespace (the table in AGENTS.md §8: `l` for
sap.ui.layout, `core` for sap.ui.core, `form` for sap.ui.layout.form, `f` for
sap.f, `u` for sap.ui.unified, …), not whatever the original happened to
declare — `structural-diff` resolves every prefix to its namespace URI on both
sides, so only the namespace has to match.

**Attributes go through `a( n = `key` v = `value` )`**, chained right after the
control's `ele`/`tag`. `a` always targets that control (the last-added child,
or the node itself if none yet), so it works after both `ele` and `tag`. `v` is
any string expression — a literal, a `client->_bind( … )` / `_event( … )` result,
or a `|…|` template. For an ABAP boolean pass `b` instead of `v` (see Booleans
below); `ele( )`/`tag( )` take `n` and `ns` only — there is no up-front
attribute table, every attribute gets its own `a( )`.

Both named XML aggregations (`<headerToolbar>`, `<layoutData>`) and controls are
just `ele`/`tag` calls — an aggregation is a nameless-namespace `ele` with no
attributes, e.g. `)->ele( \`headerToolbar\` )` (positional — a single named `n =`
would trip abaplint's `omit_parameter_name`).

**An aggregation carries the same `ns=` as the tag has in the XML** — which is
its parent control's namespace, not the default one. `<m:content>` under an
`sap.m.Page` is `)->ele( n = \`content\` ns = \`m\` )`; but a default-namespace
aggregation like `<columns>` / `<template>` / `<footer>` inside an
`sap.ui.table.Table` (whose view default `xmlns` is `sap.ui.table`) is the
nameless `)->ele( \`columns\` )`. Copy the prefix from the original tag; a
wrong or missing `ns` on an aggregation produces an unknown-aggregation node
that `render_smoke` rejects. (Worked example: app 164, `sap.ui.table` RowModes —
`m:content`/`m:OverflowToolbar` prefixed, `columns`/`extension`/`footer`/`template`
bare.)

`factory( )` returns an **empty root**. There is no implicit `<View>` — you open
the `<mvc:View>` and declare its `xmlns` namespaces yourself, exactly like any
other control:

```abap
DATA(view) = z2ui5_cl_ui5_view_builder=>factory( ).

view->ele( n = `View` ns = `mvc`
    )->a( n = `xmlns`     v = `sap.m`
    )->a( n = `xmlns:mvc` v = `sap.ui.core.mvc`
    )->a( n = `xmlns:f`   v = `sap.f`

    )->tag( `Slider`
        )->a( n = `value`      v = client->_bind( slider_value )
        )->a( n = `liveChange` v = client->_event( `SLIDER_MOVED` )

    )->ele( `Panel`
        )->a( n = `width` v = client->_bind( panel_width )
        )->ele( `headerToolbar`
            )->ele( `Toolbar`
                )->tag( `Title`
                    )->a( n = `text` v = `Header`

            )->end(
        )->end( ).

client->view_display( view->stringify( ) ).
```

`stringify( )` renders the whole tree to the XML string handed to
`client->view_display( )` as the standalone final statement. **It renders from
the root, so every tag is closed structurally — trailing `end( )`s before the
final `).` are optional.** `end( )` only moves the *cursor* up to add a sibling
at a higher level; once the last leaf/attr is placed you can end the chain with a
bare `).` (the still-open View/Panel/… nodes all close in the output). Both
styles pass every gate — a chain that closes back to the root explicitly, or one
that stops at the deepest node.

#### Formatting rules (strict — `npm run gates` checks these)

The chain is the only picture of the view's tree there is, so its layout is
load-bearing rather than cosmetic. The full rule set with a worked example is
the **`view-chain-layout` skill**, kept byte-identical in `abap2UI5` and
`abap2UI5/samples`. The first four rules below are **identical in
`abap2UI5/samples`** — the two corpora were unified in one pass after a survey
found them following opposite conventions — and the linter's
`chain-house-layout` rule checks them (`npm run check:chains`, the first step of
`npm run gates`); `npm run fmt:chains` applies them. The local
`scripts/chain-format.mjs` that used to do this a second time is gone.

- **One call per line.** Every `ele( )`, `tag( )`, `a( )` and `end( )` opens its
  own line with `)->`. A control never shares its line with the container it
  opens, nor with its own attributes.
- **The closing paren rides with the arrow.** Never leave a `)` alone at a line
  end; carry it to the **start of the next segment** so it always reads `)->`.
  With the `a()` chain there is no nested `VALUE`, so the whole view ends in a
  single `` ).`` (not `) ).`).
- **Indent after every `ele`.** Each `ele( )` shifts its children's `)->` one
  level (4 spaces) to the right; `end( )` shifts back left. The `)->` of an
  `end` sits at the same column as the `ele` it closes. The same step
  throughout — 77 ports carried a chain uniformly indented by 8, which passes
  the linter's two layout rules (neither judges the step) while saying the
  wrong thing about depth; `chain-format` is what catches that.
- **A control's `a()` lines sit one level (4 spaces) in from the control's
  own `)->` line**; align the `v =` column across them.
- **Blank lines** — the one rule that is local to this repository, because it
  belongs to the single-chain shape below; `samples` splits its views into a
  statement per subtree and has no blank lines inside a chain at all
  (attrs never count — they belong to their control):
  - **never** between consecutive `tag`s, and **never** after a **one-liner
    `ele`** (an aggregation/container with no attrs) before its first child;
  - a blank **does** separate an `ele` that *has* attrs from its first child,
    and separates a new `ele`/`tag` block from the previous sibling;
  - a blank **before** every `end`; **none** after an `end` or between `end`s;
  - **none** between a control and its own `a()`s.
- Long text/binding values split with `&&` at ~255 chars max per line (§6).
- **A wrapped `t_arg` list hangs under its FIRST element** — every continuation
  line of a `_event( )` / `follow_up_action( )` argument table starts in the
  column of the first `( … )`, not under the `#` of `VALUE #(` three columns to
  its left. Rule 7 of `view-chain-layout`.

**Outside the chain: a call that fits on one line goes on one line** (budget 120
characters). Stacking parameters is for calls that do not fit, not for calls that
happen to have two — `client->popover_display( xml = popup->stringify( ) by_id = by_id ).`
is 71 characters and needs no second line. This is the one formatting rule that
does NOT apply inside the view chain, where one call per line wins, and it never
re-joins a wrapped `t_arg`.

#### Data binding & events

- **A binding path always comes from a binding method — never hard-code it as
  text.** `client->_bind( var )` (and `client->_bind( val = var path = abap_true )`
  for the raw path) derives the model path *from the ABAP variable*, so renaming
  the variable moves the binding with it. Writing the path literally instead
  (`'/T_ITEMS'`, `` `{/T_ITEMS}` ``, `items = '{/T_ITEMS}'`, `path: '/T_ITEMS'`)
  silently breaks on the next rename and is not allowed. This holds **everywhere a
  method can produce the path**: the aggregation / model-root path
  (`_bind( … path = abap_true )`), a slot element binding
  (`follow_up_action( val = cs_event-bind_element … t_arg = VALUE #( ( idx ) ( client->_bind( tab ) ) ) )`
  — pass `client->_bind( tab )`, never the text path), a `binding_call` target, etc.
  `pattern-lint`'s `hardcoded-binding-path` rule flags ports still writing a
  binding by name. The **one unavoidable exception** is a *relative
  child property* inside a bound aggregation template — `` `{TITLE}` `` /
  `` `{PRODUCT_ID}` `` referencing an upper-cased model field, which has no `_bind`
  form (see the next bullet); keep those, but never write the absolute / model-root
  path by hand.
- **A `path:` inside a raw binding-info string uses the ABAP (upper-cased) field
  name too** — same rule as the brace form, easy to miss. A typed/sorter/Currency
  binding copied from the original keeps its *structure* 1:1 but its `path:` must
  switch to the model field: original `` `{path:'exchangeRate', type:'sap.ui.model.type.Float'}` ``
  → `` \|\{ path: 'EXCHANGE_RATE', type: 'sap.ui.model.type.Float' \}\| ``. Copying
  the original camelCase `path:'exchangeRate'` verbatim renders nothing (no such
  model field) and no gate catches it — structural-diff normalizes case,
  the render gate mocks the model (app 171).
- `client->_bind( var )` — bind an ABAP `DATA` member two-way (the value
  flows back into `var` on the next round-trip), e.g.
  `)->a( n = `items` v = client->_bind( t_items )`. **`client->_bind_edit( )`
  is obsolete — `_bind` is two-way; always use `_bind`, including for
  display-only bindings.**
- Inside a bound aggregation, child properties use UI5 binding braces on the
  upper-cased field name: `)->a( n = `text` v = `{TITLE}``.
  **But a field shared by the whole app lives at the model ROOT, and a relative
  `{FIELD}` inside a template resolves against the ROW** — it silently renders
  empty when the row has no such column. Bind those with the absolute path from
  `client->_bind( field )` even inside a template (app 207: every
  `StandardListItem`'s `type` follows one Select; the relative form left every
  item `Inactive` and the Select dead — no gate sees this, only the e2e
  interaction did).
  **The same trap outside any template: a "flattened element binding".** When
  the original does `bindElement('/ProductCollection/0')` (or a `binding=`
  attribute) and the port seeds that record's fields at the model root, the
  view must bind them **absolutely** too — a relative `{NAME}` on a control
  with *no binding context at all* resolves against nothing and renders empty.
  Seven ports carried the wrong form with a sidecar note claiming the opposite
  (142 175 195 206 209 229 243, all fixed). **That audit is static now**: the
  linter rule `relative-binding-without-context` reports a `_bind`-less
  `` v = `{FIELD}` `` on a control with no binding context whose FIELD is a
  declared class attribute (a `template` aggregation counts as a row context,
  so `sap.ui.table` column templates are not judged).
- `client->_event( \`NAME\` )` — wire a control event (press, liveChange…) to an
  event named `NAME`. **Always** dispatch in `on_event( )` off the event name,
  never off `check_on_event( )`:
  - two or more events → `CASE client->get_event( ).` … `WHEN \`NAME\`.` …
    `ENDCASE`
  - exactly one → `IF client->get_event( ) = \`NAME\`.` … `ENDIF`. This is not
    a style choice: abaplint's `short_case` refuses a `CASE` with one `WHEN`
    (2026-08-16), and `pattern-lint` knows both shapes as a dispatcher.

  Read the event with `client->get_event( )`, **not** `client->get( )-event` —
  the latter builds the whole `ty_s_get` structure to use one field of it, and
  the corpus was converted away from it on 2026-08-16. Changed bound data is
  pushed back **automatically** at the end of the round-trip (a before/after
  comparison in the framework) — do **not** write
  `client->view_model_update( )`: it has been an empty method since abap2UI5
  1.143.0, and the linter's `obsolete-model-update` fix (`npm run fmt:chains`)
  silently deletes the call, so a port relying on it would ship a diff you
  never wrote (batch b31 hit exactly that).
- **Client handle strings (`_event`, `_bind`, `follow_up_action`, …) are
  written inline at each control — never captured in a variable**, even when
  the same call repeats on many controls and even inside expression bindings
  (human decision, apps 005/053/007; pattern-lint blocks
  `DATA(x) = client->_…(`).
- Read event parameters (declared via `_event( … t_arg = … )`) with
  `client->get_event_arg( )` — the index defaults to 1; **write it only for
  position 2+** (`get_event_arg( 2 )`), never `get_event_arg( 1 )`
  (pattern-lint flags it). A **boolean** parameter (e.g. a CheckBox
  `selected`, `${$parameters>/selected}`) already arrives as `abap_bool`
  (`X` / space), **not** the string `` `true` `` — assign it straight into an
  `abap_bool` field (`flag = client->get_event_arg( ).`); never test `… = \`true\``.
- **Passing a value *into* an event uses the `$`-prefixed form — never a bare
  `{…}`.** The runtime (`z2ui5_cl_ui5_srv_event=>get_t_arg`) sends every
  `t_arg` entry that starts with `$` or `{` to the frontend **verbatim** and
  wraps everything else in quotes as a string literal. Only a **`$`-prefixed**
  arg is then resolved by UI5 (against the row's binding context / the event
  object) before the round-trip; a bare-brace `{…}` is *not* resolved and the
  value reaches `get_event_arg( )` empty. So the same model column that is a
  correct **property** binding as `` `{NOTES}` `` in an attribute
  (`)->a( n = \`tooltip\` v = \`{NOTES}\``) must be written `` `${NOTES}` `` in a
  `t_arg` (`t_arg = VALUE #( ( \`${NOTES}\` ) )`). The same `$`-prefix rule
  covers the UI5 event object: `` `$event.oSource.sId` `` (the pressed
  control's id — app 005), `` `${$source>/text}` `` (a bound property of the
  event source — app 003), `` `$event.mParameters.selectedItems` `` (app 022).
- **Don't fake a value you can actually read from the event.** When the original
  controller reads something off the event/source (`evt.getSource().getId()`,
  `evt.getParameter(...)`), transport it with the `$event.…` arg above and read
  it back with `get_event_arg( )` — do **not** substitute a static placeholder
  (app 005's toast carries the real control id via `` `$event.oSource.sId` ``).
- **A property computed from several bound values → a UI5 expression binding
  `{= … }`.** Write every `client->_bind( … )` call inline, embedded with
  `${ … }` — the never-capture rule above applies inside expression bindings
  too (repeated calls to `_bind` on the same variable return the same handle).
  Build the expression with an ABAP string template, escaping the UI5 braces
  and any pipes: e.g. a "select all"/"partially selected" pair —
  `` v = |\{= ${ client->_bind( child1 ) } \|\| ${ client->_bind( child2 ) } \|\| ${ client->_bind( child3 ) } \}| `` (OR)
  and `` v = |\{= !(${ client->_bind( child1 ) } && ${ client->_bind( child2 ) } && ${ client->_bind( child3 ) })\}| ``
  (NOT-AND). Worked example: app 007 (`sap.m.CheckBox` tri-state parent). Do the
  logic in the binding, not by round-tripping — no event needed to keep the
  parent box in sync.

#### Booleans

A literal boolean is just `)->a( n = `editable` v = `true``. **Only** when the
value comes from an ABAP boolean variable, pass it as `b` instead of `v`:
`)->a( n = `editable` b = flag )` — the builder renders it as `true`/`false`
itself, while a raw `abap_false` fed through `v` would serialise to an empty
string. Never feed `abap_true`/`abap_false` straight into `v`. Exactly one of
the two is passed, never both and never neither.

#### The 1.71 rule in practice

The **control** must exist since UI5 1.71 and not be deprecated — otherwise
the sample is out of scope and is never ported (pre-check with
`node scripts/scope-of.mjs <entity>`); never silently substitute a different
control. **Members** (properties/aggregations/associations/events) newer than
1.71 ARE kept when the original uses them — 1:1 fidelity wins (AGENTS §5) —
and each one is declared as a `POST_171` deviation naming the member (app 040
keeps `showClearIcon` @1.94 that way; the app then needs a UI5 release ≥ that
member's version to render it). `DROPPED_171` remains only for the rare
member that genuinely cannot be expressed.

#### Generation notes — record every caveat in the sidecar

When the port is **not** a clean 1:1 — you improvised, dropped/downgraded
something for 1.71, replaced a controller-only behaviour, or relied on a
binding/event form you could not verify — record it as an entry in the
`deviations` array of `meta/<class>.json` (the sidecar contract is AGENTS.md §5). One entry per caveat,
with a closed `type` vocabulary so deviations stay countable:

- `LIVE_TEST` — needs checking in a running system: an unverified
  binding/event path, or uncertain rendering (e.g. app 003's `${$source>/text}`
  event arg).
- `IMPROVISED` — **materially deviates** from the sample: the port loses or
  changes something: a MessageManager replaced by a hardcoded message table
  (app 038), a fold that **drops bound columns** or resolves a live model
  statically. A named model flattened to static values is NOT automatically
  this — app 006's `img>` fold keeps the mock's own values (re-hosted, so they
  resolve) and renders identically, which makes it a `NOTE`; this list named it
  as the `IMPROVISED` example until 2026-08-21, and its own sidecar disagreed. Only improvise what `CAPABILITIES.md` does not mark expressible —
  app 042's Dialog→toast substitution was a wrong improvisation; app 044 shows
  the 1:1 way (`popup_display`).
- `DROPPED_171` — a control / property / enum value newer than 1.71 was
  dropped or downgraded (app 042's `Indication06`+ states set to `None`).
- `SUBSET_DATA` — **retired: no longer accepted.** Ports inline the full mock
  row set (see `model_init` above); `validate-meta` now rejects this type.
  Kept in the vocabulary only so historical diffs stay readable.
- `NOTE` — a faithful port with a caveat worth recording but **no loss**. This
  is the type for a **pure named-model prefix-drop that renders identically** —
  same data, same leaf name, `structural-diff` 0 diffs (`{ui>/rowMode}`→`{/ROWMODE}`,
  `{img>/pic1}`→`{/PIC1}` with the real value); the model layer differs, the
  output does not, so it is not IMPROVISED. Also: a deterministic-date
  substitution, a device-branch simplification, anything else worth flagging.
  **Settled policy:** NOTE for a same-data prefix-drop, IMPROVISED only for a
  lossy/static fold.
  **Refinement:** "renders identically" is **not** sufficient for NOTE when
  the fold **drops a control/config artifact** — a `sap.uxap:ModelMapping`
  (or its `ModelMappingBlock`), a `core:CommandExecution`, an `i18n` resource
  model. Removing a control the original declares (even a zero-visual-output
  config element) or losing a behaviour (runtime language switch, keyboard
  command) **is a loss → IMPROVISED**, regardless of pixel-identical render. The
  pure-render test decides only the *prefix-drop* case; dropping an artifact is
  lossy by definition. (Apps 230 ModelMapping, 232 CommandExecution, 233 i18n.)

The `what` text carries the full explanation. Keep the array **empty** for a
faithful 1:1 port. Still add the inline `"` comment at the exact spot of each
deviation in the ABAP code; the sidecar is the scannable summary of those —
the structural diff (§6) matches undeclared view differences against exactly
these entries.


#### Porting gotchas (distilled lessons — same discipline as AGENTS.md §10)

- **When the original calls a METHOD, read that method before binding a
  property in its place.** The recipe prefers a bindable property over a
  frontend action, and that is right — but only when the property is the one
  the method writes. `DynamicSideContent.toggle( )` does NOT write
  `showSideContent`: it swaps a private `_MCVisible`/`_SCVisible` pair and
  leaves the property at its default, and `setShowSideContent` re-derives those
  flags through `_setResizeData( )`. Apps 344/138 bound the property and shipped
  a Toggle button that could not toggle. Two minutes in
  `node_modules/@openui5/…/<Control>.js` settles it.
- **An event parameter can be DECLARED and never fired.** `QuickSort.change`
  lists `key` and `sortOrder` in its `metadata.events` and its own `onChange`
  does `this.fireChange({item: oItem})` — nothing else. App 298 read the
  declared names, got two empty strings on every firing, and fell through to a
  default sort. The linter's event-parameter check *prefers* the declared
  names, so it steers you into the bug; when the sample's own controller reads
  a different parameter, follow the sample and carry the linter finding as a
  declared advisory. Grep the control for `fire<Event>(` and see what it
  actually passes.
- **Read the parameter's doc comment, not just its name.** `sap.ui.table`'s
  `rowIndices` is "array of row indices which selection has been CHANGED
  (either selected or deselected)", not the current selection — app 361
  reported `[1]` where the original reports `[0,1]`. When the original asks the
  CONTROL (`getSelectedIndices( )`), transport that:
  `${$source>}.getSelectedIndices()`.
- **A list the original builds from `Object.keys(SomeEnum)` must match the enum
  in members AND order.** App 356 offered a fourth value `All` that
  `sap.ui.table.SelectionMode` does not define, bound straight onto an
  enum-typed property — `validateProperty` throws. Open the enum in
  `node_modules/@openui5/…/library.js`.
- **`check_prevent_default` is baked per WIRE, not per firing.** A handler that
  vetoes ONE column and returns early for the others needs
  `s_ctrl = VALUE #( prevent_default_expr = `…` )`; the boolean form vetoed all
  five of app 354's columns and left four `filterProperty` columns plus the
  whole `enableCellFilter` feature inert.
- **Seeding a value the original does not set can hide a placeholder.**
  `sap.m.Input` drops its placeholder as soon as a value exists, so app 363's
  three `"0"`s replaced three hints the sample shows. If the original view
  carries no `value`, the port carries none either.
- **A formatter is business logic — port the whole rule, units included.**
  `Formatter.weightState`'s boundaries are 1 and 5 KILOGRAMS and it divides a
  `G` row by 1000 first; apps 377/298 compared the raw measure against
  1000/2000 and mis-coloured 66 of 123 rows. Copy from a `checked` sibling
  (app 009 had it right) rather than from the nearest port.
- **Check literal texts against THIS sample's own files.** Apps 357/360 took
  two column headers from a neighbouring sample's `metadata.xml` while their
  deviations asserted the texts came from their own.
- **Dropping a handler does not disarm the control that carried it.**
  `DropInfo.isDroppable` never asks whether anyone is listening, so app 365
  kept draggable rows and a live drop indicator that discarded every drop.
  Switch the configuration off (`enabled="false"`) or remove it, and declare
  which.

- **A bare decimal literal is not valid ABAP** — `price = 2.3` inside a
  `VALUE #( )` lexes as `2` · `.` · `3`, and the dot ENDS the statement, so the
  whole block becomes a parser error (and a generated 123-row block reports it
  once per row). Write the number as a character literal, `` price = `2.3` ``,
  which converts into the packed field on assignment (the app-174 style);
  integers stay bare. abaplint catches it, but only after the file is written —
  a data generator must emit it right (batch b20).
- **`DELETE itab FROM n.` is `ambiguous_statement`** — `DELETE itab FROM n1
  [TO n2]` (index range) and `DELETE dbtab FROM wa` (database) are the same
  words, and abaplint refuses to guess. Say what you mean: a `TO` bound, a
  `DELETE … INDEX`, or — usually better — do not build the rows you are about
  to delete (`demo_004` narrows five promoted products to two with a
  `IF lines( t ) < 2.` guard at the INSERT).
- **`DELETE itab WHERE` takes no functional expression** — `DELETE t WHERE
  to_upper( name ) NS q.` is a parser error, the `WHERE` of an internal-table
  statement accepts only comparisons of components against values. Loop
  instead: `LOOP AT t INTO DATA(row). IF … . DELETE t INDEX sy-tabix. ENDIF.
  ENDLOOP.` (apps 352/354).
- **A DOTTED element name in the original view is a sub-package, not a
  control name** — `<plugins.MultiSelectionPlugin>` under a `sap.ui.table`
  default `xmlns` (and `<m:plugins.PasteProvider>`) resolves as
  `sap.ui.table.plugins.MultiSelectionPlugin` / `sap.m.plugins.PasteProvider`.
  The builder has no such form, so declare a real prefix — the canonical
  `tp` for `sap.ui.table.plugins` (AGENTS.md §8 table) — and write
  `tp:MultiSelectionPlugin`. `structural-diff` resolves both prefixes to
  their namespace URI, so `tp:MultiSelectionPlugin` IS the original's
  `plugins.MultiSelectionPlugin` and needs no deviation (app 360; it needed one
  while the gate still compared the prefix as written).

- **The default namespace is not always `sap.m`.** A `sap.uxap` / `sap.ui.table`
  sample often declares its own library as `xmlns` and gives **`sap.m` the
  prefix** (`xmlns:m="sap.m"`, `<m:List>`). Keep the NAMESPACE assignment —
  which library is the default and which ones are prefixed — and use the
  canonical prefixes for the prefixed ones (AGENTS.md §8 table).
  `structural-diff` resolves prefixes to namespace URIs, so the prefix spelling
  is free but the namespace is not: a `List` written without `ns` in a view
  whose default `xmlns` is `sap.uxap` is `sap.uxap.List`, a different control
  from the original's `m:List`, and is reported in both directions (app 293).

- **One builder chain per view — in this repository.** A port mirrors one
  original XML file, so it gets one method with one chain per fragment, exactly
  as the original has one file per fragment (app 285). The reason is fidelity,
  not capability: a popup helper parameterized with id/title (`COND #( … )` in
  an attribute) is unreconstructable *and* leaves `structural-diff` counting one
  popup where the original has three.

  **This rule is local to this repository, and the reason once given for it was
  wrong.** Splitting a view into a statement per subtree — hold the container in
  a variable, start a new statement from it — does *not* break reconstruction:
  it is the normal shape in `abap2UI5/samples`, where the same linter
  reconstructs all 172 documents from it and renders every one. What broke in
  app 285 was that one helper, not the split as such. When a port genuinely
  needs a subtree filled from a loop or a node filled twice, the split is
  available; it is simply not the default here.

- **A per-keystroke round-trip needs BOTH `s_ctrl` flags.** abap2UI5
  serializes round-trips, and an ordinary wire is lossy *and* flashes the busy
  overlay. Register every `liveChange`/`liveSearch`/`suggest` wire that
  round-trips as `client->_event( val = … s_ctrl = VALUE #(
  check_queue_last = abap_true check_no_busy = abap_true ) )`:
  - `check_queue_last` keeps the LAST event fired while a trip is in flight
    and dispatches it after the response, so the backend ends on the typed
    value. Without it the wire shows the value of the last *completed* trip
    (measured on app 280 — typing `abc` with no delay left the bound field at
    `a` while the TextArea held `abc`).
  - `check_no_busy` keeps the full-screen busy overlay down. Without it the
    FIRST trip raises the indicator after the usual delay, but every keystroke
    landing on a trip already in flight raises it with NO delay — deliberate,
    because a dropped *click* needs feedback at once, and exactly wrong while
    typing. From the second character on the overlay sits over the very field
    being typed into, where the demo kit original (a plain client-side
    handler) shows nothing at all. Reported from app 101.
  Intermediate values can still be skipped under fast typing, so prefer a
  two-way binding or an expression binding whenever the sample's point allows
  it; when the round-trip is required, set both flags and say so in the
  sidecar. With the flags an e2e interaction may type with **no** delay and
  assert the final value. The flags are for wires driven by TYPING — a
  one-shot wire using `check_queue_last` to survive the busy guard during the
  initial render (demo_004's `Storage`/`finished`) keeps its overlay, because
  there the app really is loading.
- **Event args need the `$`-prefixed form** (`${COL}`, `$event.oSource.sId`), not
  a bare `{COL}` — see "Data binding & events" in this guide.
- **A UI5 *association* cannot be data-bound** — only properties and
  aggregations can, so the scalar-literal->two-way-binding move (this guide) does not
  apply to one. `sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout.selectedSection` reads like a
  property but is declared under `associations:`; drive it through
  `follow_up_action( val = cs_event-control_by_id t_arg = ( id )
  ( \`setSelectedSection\` ) ( … ) )` instead. An **empty/null association
  argument is not transportable** either — pass the id you actually want (app
  263 resets to the first section's id, which is what UI5's own
  `_adjustSelectedSectionByUXRules` falls back to when the association is
  empty). Before binding something that "should" be a property, grep the
  control source for `associations:`.
- **abap2UI5 has only one default model** — flatten any named-model binding into
  it — see "`model_init` — the model" in this guide.
- **`_bind( val = x path = abap_true )` returns the bare model path**
  (no braces) — use it when composing raw binding-info strings
  (`{ path: '...', sorter: ... }`); never reconstruct the path with substring
  tricks (app 039).
- **An event parameter that is an ARRAY arrives as JSON, not as a joined
  string.** `${$parameters>/fieldGroupIds}` reaches `on_event` as
  `["Billing Information"]`, brackets and quotes included. Index it in the
  expression — `${$parameters>/fieldGroupIds}[0]`, which is also literally
  what the original controller does — the UI5 expression grammar accepts
  `[n]` and method calls (app 272). Do not "fix" this by string-stripping in
  ABAP.
- **UI5 2.x validates control property types strictly** — a bound value that
  serializes as a JSON string is rejected when the property is a number/boolean
  (`"100" is of type string, expected float` on `sap.m.Slider.value`, app 053).
  Type the bound ABAP field numerically (`i`/packed) or as `abap_bool`, never
  as `string`, so the model carries a real JSON number/boolean. But a
  **display-only** value with variable decimals bound into a *text template*
  (`{WIDTH} x {DEPTH}`, dimensions `40.8`) stays `TYPE string` — packed with a
  fixed `DECIMALS` would add trailing zeros (`40.80`); string keeps it exact.
  **An EDITABLE table cell is the other exception — next bullet.**
- **A numeric field bound into an EDITABLE table cell is dropped SILENTLY —
  mirror it as a string.** A cell ships a `__delta` and lands in
  `z2ui5_cl_ui5_srv_model->delta_apply_field`, whose whole body ends in
  `CATCH cx_root ##NO_HANDLER` — "skip just this cell". So text that will not
  convert into the packed/`i` target leaves the backend on its OLD value while
  the browser goes on showing what was typed: no exception, no toast, no
  `valueState`. The scalar path is the opposite and that is what makes this easy
  to miss — `main_json_to_attri` re-raises as `JSON_PARSING_ERROR`, so the same
  bad input on a plain bound attribute is loud. Measured against the transpiled
  backend on app 570 (`PRICE`, row 1 = 956): `1250.00` → `1250` writes back, but
  `1,250.00`, `1 250`, `12.50 EUR`, `1250,00` and `abc` ALL left the model on its
  previous value with no error, no toast and no `valueState` — and a lone `-`, an
  emptied cell and a blanks-only cell each silently became `0.00`. In app 093,
  `1,455.22` typed into Salary came back from the round trip as `1455.22`, the
  old value. Two remedies, and which one applies is decided by whether anything
  still needs the number: where it does (570 keeps `PRICE` packed for the
  read-only template's Currency composite binding), bind the editable cell to a
  **string mirror** — app 351's `MINSIZE_TEXT` idiom, app 363 does the same for
  three counts: a `…_TEXT` string column in the row type, seeded from the packed
  field when EDIT starts, parsed back on SAVE under a digit/character/length
  guard plus `TRY … CATCH`, so a row that will not convert keeps its value, has
  its text put back, and the app STAYS in edit mode with a toast naming the
  entry — reported, never discarded. Where nothing needs the number (093's
  `SALARY` carries no typed binding), just make the field `TYPE string`, which is
  what the original's JSONModel holds anyway.
- **A `client->_event( )` in the view needs an `on_event` branch that handles
  it** — otherwise the wire fires a full backend round-trip that falls through
  every `CASE` and the app does nothing, while *looking* wired (pattern-lint
  rule `dead-event-wire`: no class with `->_event(` and no
  `on_event`/`check_on_event`). Two legitimate resolutions, no third:
  **dispatch it** (a `CASE` branch that changes bound state — the model push
  back is automatic — or a `message_box_display`/`popover_display`), or
  **drop the wire** — if the behaviour is genuinely inexpressible, the
  attribute goes away and the loss is declared. Before dropping, check
  CAPABILITIES.md: most "not reproducible" rationales in this class turned
  out to be wrong — the behaviour was expressible as a two-way binding +
  expression binding, a real dispatcher, or the full drag & drop reorder.
- **Range-check any index that arrives from the frontend before using it as a
  table index** — JS splices a nonsense index harmlessly, `t[ i ]` in ABAP
  **dumps**. A drag & drop `drop` handler receives both row indices from the
  client, so a stale or malformed value reaches `on_event` as an ordinary
  event arg. Guard with `lines( )` and return early rather than trusting the
  client (app 148).
- **An OPTIONAL date in a bound row needs a guard in the binding** — one bound
  template cannot omit an attribute per row, so a row whose date field is empty
  still goes through the formatter: `Formatter.DateCreateObject('')` is
  `new Date('')` = **Invalid Date**, which is *truthy*, so every consumer that
  branches on the property throws and the whole view dies — the app renders
  **zero** days, not a degraded one. Guard the conversion in the binding:
  ``` `{= ${END} ? Formatter.DateCreateObject(${END}) : null }` ``` in a
  **backtick** literal (a `|…|` template would eat the braces). Do **not**
  "fix" it by seeding `end = start`: `_checkDateEnabled` compares a range
  strictly exclusive and reaches its single-day branch only when there is no
  `endDate` at all, so that seeds a range disabling nothing (app 220;
  pattern-lint rule `unguarded-date-formatter`).
- **A picker that binds `value` needs a `valueFormat` — unless the binding is
  typed.** Measured headless against the real OpenUI5 runtime (2026-08-26, apps
  549/609): with no `valueFormat` a `DateTimePicker` READS the model's ISO string
  but writes a LOCALE string back (`Jul 12, 2018, 2:30:00 PM`), and a
  `DatePicker` cannot read it at all — it displayed the raw
  `2018-07-09T09:00:00`, had no date value, and wrote back `7/12/18`. Give the
  picker a `valueFormat` — apps 549/609 settled on
  `valueFormat="yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss"` on all four of theirs, so both pairs read
  and write the same 19-character ISO string the ABAP field holds. What the omission
  costs is not cosmetic. Apps 548/555 dropped their original's typed binding
  (`type: 'sap.ui.model.type.DateTime'` plus `formatOptions.pattern`) and kept
  only the path: in en-US that is a corrupted shape, but in **de-DE** — German is
  a first-class `sy-langu` — the user picks 4 March 2025, the model stores
  `04.03.2025, 10:15:00`, and `Formatter.DateCreateObject`'s `new Date( )` reads
  it MONTH-first, so the appointment is drawn on **3 April**, silently, with no
  error anywhere. App 547 is the same class from the other side: its original
  binds no `value` at all (it works in `Date` objects through
  `setDateValue`/`getDateValue`), so the string binding is the PORT's and so is
  the format contract it owes — its check compares the two bound strings
  (`d_end <= d_start`), which is only meaningful while both stay
  lexicographically sortable ISO; the first edit wrote `Jan 10, 2017, 8:00:00 AM`,
  the compare stopped firing, and the dialog accepted an appointment ending five
  days before it started. Prefer `valueFormat` over restoring a typed binding
  wherever the picker can be **cleared**: a typed binding with a source pattern
  raises on the empty value a cleared picker sends. **No gate sees this** — the
  port HAS a `value` attribute, so structural-diff reads nothing as missing — so
  it needs a declared NOTE.
- **abaplint `commented_code` can fire on an ordinary English comment** — a
  `"` view-description comment containing a `/` next to CamelCase UI5 identifiers
  (e.g. `" bound to RowSettings highlight/highlightText`) lexes like ABAP and is
  rejected as commented-out code. Reword (drop the slash, or split the
  identifiers) — app 174.
- **Prefer a bindable property over a frontend action / round-trip** — if a
  control exposes its state as a property (`IconTabBar.selectedKey`,
  `visible="{= … }"`, the `device>` model), bind it (two-way) instead of
  driving it imperatively. Only methods with no bindable equivalent
  (`NavContainer.to`, `focus`, `scrollToIndex`) need a frontend action.
  Compare app 088 (NavContainer + action) with the IconTabBar samples.
- **Client-side-only state does not survive a view rebuild** — a value the
  frontend never sends back (a `SearchField` with no bound `value`) and a
  `binding_call` filter/sorter (it acts on the aggregation binding, not on the
  model) are gone the moment the backend rebuilds the view: another round-trip,
  a draft restore, the browser Back button after `nav_app_call`. Bind the value
  two-way so it travels with the next event, and re-apply the binding operation
  in `view_display` via `follow_up_action( cs_event-binding_call … )` when the
  restored value is non-initial (the overview app's search). Sort state stays
  client-only: a view-wired `follow_up_action` sort cannot write to the model, so it is
  deliberately lost.
  **The same is true of any `control_by_id` setter whose value cannot be
  bound** — an association, a function-typed property, or a setter behind no
  property at all — which is the broader and more productive half of this class;
  the linter reports it as `control-state-lost-on-rebuild`, and the full idiom
  (which helper to re-issue, what to guard on, why a draft restore reaches
  `view_display( )` a second time without any navigation) is the
  rebuild-survival row of the `idiom-lookup` cheat-sheet.
- **A listed control method silently drops arguments beyond its
  declared kinds** — `castArgs` in `FrontendAction.js` maps over the
  `CONTROL_METHODS` kinds list, so a `to` transition name or a
  ViewSettingsDialog `open` page key never reaches the method; the call
  "works" and the behavior is quietly wrong. Verify the method's kinds in
  the framework source BEFORE wiring a parametrized call; if the sample
  needs the arg, that is a declared deviation **plus a pr/ request in the
  same change** — never a LIVE_TEST for something source-decidable
  (pr/control-method-args). An UNLISTED public method that does not match
  the deny regex runs too (plain setters/toggles) — see the cheat-sheet row.
- **POST_171 covers event *parameters* too** — a post-1.71 event parameter
  read via `${$parameters>/…}` (e.g. SearchField `searchButtonPressed`,
  since 1.114) needs its POST_171 deviation exactly like a bound member;
  the property gate enforces this (it scans `$parameters>/<name>` refs in
  `t_arg` and resolves them against the same member map as attributes, §6).
