    " The calendar's OWN selection, as the model owns it. selectedDates is a
    " bindable aggregation of sap.ui.unified.DateRange, exactly like the
    " disabledDates app 220 binds - so the highlight is expressible after all,
    " and handleSelectToday's removeAllSelectedDates + addSelectedDate(today)
    " becomes "replace the one row". The deviation here used to say the
    " highlight could not be moved because addSelectedDate takes a DateRange
    " CONTROL no wire can construct: true of the METHOD, and beside the point,
    " since the aggregation never needed the method. Every click round-trips
    " through CAL_SELECT, so the model is the source of truth and the control's
    " own click-selection is re-stated rather than fought.
