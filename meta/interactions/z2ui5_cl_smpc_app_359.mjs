// RowAction: the bound rowActionCount has to follow each mode the Select
// picks, and the union template's per-item visible flags have to switch with
// it — that is the half of the deviation this harness can settle.
//
// The other half, the two-placeholder toast on a row-action PRESS, is not
// reachable here and this module deliberately does not pretend otherwise: the
// row actions never render at all in the smoke. Measured 2026-08-21 — the
// action cells hold nothing but their navIndicator div, in Navigation mode and
// in Multiple Actions mode alike, and calling `setRowActionCount(2)` plus
// `invalidate()` DIRECTLY on the table through its own API (bypassing the port
// entirely) still leaves every row without a `_rowAction`.
//
// That experiment was read as ruling the port out. It does not, and the reading
// was withdrawn 2026-08-24: NEITHER of the two calls it makes re-creates a row
// clone. `_rowAction` is attached only in `_getRowClone()`, guarded by
// `hasRowActions()` (needs `getRowActionCount() > 0`), and the only things that
// re-run it are `invalidateRowsAggregation()` — reached from
// `setRowActionTemplate`, not from `setRowActionCount` — and a column-aggregation
// change. Plain `invalidate()` is not one of them. So the experiment reproduces
// the port's own gap rather than excluding it, and cannot tell "the rows never
// got a `_rowAction`" apart from "the smoke cannot render the icons". The
// discriminating call is `oTable.invalidateRowsAggregation()`, which is what the
// original triggers on every switchState. The underlying gap is fixed in the
// port as of 2026-08-24 (a mode change that raises the count off 0 re-displays
// the slot); until this module is re-measured with that call, the toast leg
// stays with the human live run — but NOT on the grounds stated above. See
// meta/interactions/README.md "still open".
