/*
 * generate-samples-md — SAMPLES.md, the catalogue you can read without an SAP
 * system.
 *
 * This repository had two documents about its ports and neither answered the
 * question somebody arrives with. `api.md` is a COVERAGE table: one row per
 * demo kit sample including the 300 that are not ported, keyed by control and
 * built to show what is missing. The in-system overview app is the catalogue,
 * and reaching it costs an installed framework, an abapGit pull and an HTTP
 * handler. Until then a visitor sees 431 classes called
 * `z2ui5_cl_smpc_app_<number>`, and "is there a port that shows X" has no
 * answer on GitHub.
 *
 * Since the ports carry `" @keywords` and `" @summary`, the catalogue can be
 * written from the classes themselves - which is the point: the same two lines
 * feed this page, the overview app's search box and abap2UI5/mcp-server, so none
 * of the three can say something the class does not.
 *
 * The row shape is deliberately IDENTICAL to abap2UI5/samples and
 * abap2UI5/samples-stack:
 *
 *   | **<title>** — <sub-title>        | [`CLASS`](path) |
 *     <br>the summary sentence
 *     <br><sub>the search terms</sub>
 *
 * One parser reads all three catalogues (mcp-server's `examples` tool), and a
 * reader who has seen one page can read the other two. A change to the shape
 * here is a change to a contract, not to a layout.
 *
 * WHAT THE TITLE IS. The bold half is the CONTROL — the sidecar's `entity`,
 * the one thing an agent asks this catalogue for. It used to be the DESCRIPT's
 * first half, and 241 of the 430 rows carried only their LIBRARY there
 * ("sap.m"), because the scaffolder's DESCRIPT default is
 * `<library> - <truncated demo kit sentence>` — a known gap recorded in
 * abap2UI5/mcp-server's AGENTS.md, whose fix belongs exactly here. After the
 * em dash comes the demo kit's own name for the sample
 * (ui5/descriptions.json, via scripts/lib/sample-names.mjs) whenever it says
 * more than the control already does: `**sap.ui.table.Table** — Basic`,
 * `**sap.m.Wizard** — Wizard Branching`, but plain `**sap.m.Bar**` rather
 * than `sap.m.Bar — Bar`. That is byte-for-byte the `title — sub` form the
 * shared parser has always read on the sibling pages, and the same
 * entity-leads composition mcp-server's catalogue.json adapter produces, so
 * the two surfaces of this corpus finally answer with the same words. The
 * src/03 collection has no sidecar and no demo kit sample; its DESCRIPT
 * `<library> - <control tail>` IS the control name split at the library, so
 * the two halves are joined back (`sap.viz.ui5.controls.VizFrame`) — the same
 * full name each collection class states in its own `@summary`.
 *
 * The one addition this repository makes to that shape is a TRAILING block per
 * row — `<br><sub>✓ checked · 2 deviations</sub>` — carrying the sidecar's
 * verification status, which used to live only in meta/<class>.json and
 * STATUS.md, invisible to anybody browsing the catalogue. It is safe against
 * the shared parser BY ITS DESIGN, not by luck: mcp-server matches the blocks
 * after a row title as one group and reads the FIRST `<sub>` that does not
 * start `docs:` as the keywords, ignoring blocks it does not know — exactly so
 * that a catalogue can grow a block without breaking the other two. The marker
 * therefore comes AFTER the keywords block and is only emitted when a keywords
 * block exists, or it would be mistaken for one.

# The sample catalogue

Every port in this repository — ${ports.length + sapui5.length} of them — with what it shows and a
link to its source. This is the [overview app](${overview ? overview.rel : ''})
as a page you can read here, before installing anything.

**What this repository is:** the UI5 demo kit, rebuilt in ABAP. Each port
answers "how is this control expressed in abap2UI5", and its sentence below is
the demo kit's own description of the sample it was rebuilt from. For the
neighbouring question — *has somebody already built an app that does X* — see
[abap2UI5/samples](https://github.com/abap2UI5/samples/blob/main/SAMPLES.md);
for apps that need something from your stack (OData, RAP, APC, the launchpad),
[abap2UI5/samples-stack](https://github.com/abap2UI5/samples-stack/blob/main/SAMPLES.md).
All three pages have the same shape on purpose.

**To run one:** install [abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5), pull
this repository with [abapGit](https://abapgit.org), then open
\`<your endpoint>?app_start=<the class in the right-hand column>\`. Or start
\`${overview ? overview.cls.toUpperCase() : ''}\` and click through them there.

**To read one:** click the class. Every port is a single class, so the link is
the whole sample.

**How far each one is verified** — the small marker closing a row:
✓ \`checked\`, a human watched this port run in a real system ·
◐ \`reviewed\`, read against its original, not yet run ·
○ \`generated\`, machine-written and not yet reviewed.
\`· n deviations\` counts the declared, typed differences from the original —
what each one is lives in the port's \`meta/<class>.json\`, and
[STATUS.md](STATUS.md) carries the corpus-wide tallies. The SAPUI5 collection
at the end carries no marker: those are hand-written samples, not ports.

For what is NOT here — which demo kit samples are still unported and why — see
[api.md](api.md), the coverage table.

## The ports — by UI5 library

${jump}

${body}

---

## UI5 demo apps — \`src/04\`

${demoapps.length} of the demo kit's own [demo apps](https://sdk.openui5.org/demoapps) —
whole applications rather than single-control samples — each rebuilt as ONE
self-contained abap2UI5 class. They are not 1:1 control ports and carry no
sidecar: what deviates from the original (a router, a browser-side model, an
OData mock server) is named in the class's own ABAP Doc header.

${table(demoapps)}

${notRebuilt}

---

## SAPUI5-only controls — \`src/03\`

${sapui5.length} controls that ship with SAPUI5 and not with OpenUI5, so there is no demo
kit original in this repository's sample universe and no 1:1 port. They are
collected as orientation — how the control is expressed in abap2UI5 — and are
held to a lower bar than the ports above.

${table(sapui5)}

---

_Generated from the classes and their sidecars: the bold title is the control
(\`entity\` in \`meta/<class>.json\`), the name after the dash is the demo
kit's own name for the sample (\`ui5/descriptions.json\`) where it says more
than the control does, the sentence is \`" @summary\`, the small type is
\`" @keywords\` and the verification marker is the sidecar's \`status\`.
Change one of those and this page moves with it — \`npm run samples:md\`._
