/* The app is not answering a roundtrip of its own.
 *
 * THE FRONTEND DROPS AN EVENT FIRED WHILE ONE IS IN FLIGHT, and silently:
 * View1.eB( ) returns early on `AppState.state.isBusy`, showing the busy
 * indicator and nothing else. No error, no console line, no request. From here
 * that looks exactly like a wire that was never attached - the press fires,
 * the listener is there, and the backend simply never hears about it.
 *
 * It cost four ports to learn (575, 578, 579, 584, all flexible-column
 * layouts). Their interactions press a row as soon as the master table has
 * rendered, and rendering a FlexibleColumnLayout fires columnResize, which
 * those samples wire to the backend - so the boot roundtrip they start was
 * still open when the press landed, and the press went nowhere. The failure
 * read as "pressing a row never opened the mid column", which is true and
 * says nothing about why.
 *
 * So: wait for the app to be idle before driving it. Not `networkidle` -
 * that is the browser's view and says nothing about a queue this frontend
 * keeps itself - and not a sleep, which is the same race with a longer fuse.
 * Two consecutive frames of not-busy, because `isBusy` dips between a
 * response landing and the next event being queued.
