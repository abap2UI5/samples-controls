/*
 * generate-summary — give every port the sentence the demo kit says about it.
 *
 * `" @keywords` answers "which words find this port". `" @summary` answers the
 * next question - "is this the one I want" - and until now nothing in the
 * repository answered it. The class DESCRIPT tries: it is
 *
 *   sap.m.Breadcrumbs - breadcrumb trail with separator
 *
 * cut at 60 characters because that is all abapGit's short text holds, which
 * on many ports means cut mid-sentence ("An ActionListItem can be used like a").
 *
 * The full sentence exists and SAP wrote it - it is what the demo kit prints
 * under the sample title - and it says what the sample DEMONSTRATES, which no
 * amount of reading the ABAP recovers. It was simply not in this repository:
 * it lives in the OpenUI5 sources in `demokit/docuindex.json`, not in the
 * per-sample `manifest.json` that the ui5/ archive copies. So this is a fetch,
 * not an authorship exercise: `scripts/fetch-descriptions.mjs` snapshots those
 * entries into ui5/descriptions.json and this script writes them onto the
 * classes. Nothing here is invented.
 *
 * Where a port's summary comes from, in order:
 *
 *   1. ui5/descriptions.json `demokit`   the demo kit's own description of the
 *                                        sample named in meta/<class>.json.
 *                                        414 of 431 ports.
 *   2. ui5/descriptions.json `written`   the handful the demo kit does not
 *                                        describe - two shared "base" pages
 *                                        that are not samples of their own,
 *                                        one sample whose upstream description
 *                                        is empty. Each carries a `why`.
 *   3. derived, for the SAPUI5-only      src/03 holds controls that ship with
 *      collection (src/03)               SAPUI5 and not with OpenUI5: no demo
 *                                        kit original, no 1:1 port, no meta
 *                                        sidecar. Their line is composed from
 *                                        the entity in their own ABAP Doc.
 *   4. ui5/demoapps.json, for the        src/04 rebuilds whole demo kit
 *      demo apps (src/04)                APPLICATIONS. The demo kit describes
 *                                        those on its demo apps page, not on a
 *                                        sample page, so the sentence comes
 *                                        from that snapshot instead.
 *
 * A port that fits none of the four is a FAILURE, not a silent skip - it means
 * a new sample arrived that upstream does not describe, and somebody has to add
 * a `written` entry (with a `why`) rather than let the gap pass unnoticed.
 *
 * One line, because a `"` comment is one line and abaplint holds lines to 255
 * characters. 62 of the 800 upstream descriptions are longer than that - 29 of
 * them on ported samples - and those are cut back to the last sentence that
 * still fits, see `fit`.
 *
 *   node scripts/generate-summary.mjs          write the lines
 *   node scripts/generate-summary.mjs --check  fail if a line is missing or
 *                                              out of date (CI runs this)
