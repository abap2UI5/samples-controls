/*
 * check-pins — the abap2UI5 pin policy, gated.
 *
 * WHY: the framework version the corpus builds against is pinned in exactly
 * one place — A2UI5_PIN (a commit SHA, moved via bump-a2ui5.yaml). The
 * abaplint configs resolve the same dependency by URL, and abaplint accepts
 * an optional `"branch"` key there. That key is a second, silent pin: a
 * feature-branch re-point that survives a merge keeps CI linting against a
 * branch that will be deleted, and JSON parsing takes the LAST of duplicate
 * keys, so a stale `"branch"` left NEXT to the intended one is invisible to
 * every consumer that just parses the file. Both actually happened: on
 * 2026-08-10 the 702 config carried the branch of the already-merged-and-
 * deleted `ai-demokit-next-steps` branch next to its own `"branch": "702"`
 * (docs/history.md). This check makes that class of drift fail offline, in
 * `npm run gates`, where the edit happens.
 *
 * This repository resolves abap2UI5 THREE times, and that is deliberate — each
 * answers a different question, so one value could not serve all three:
 *
 *   A2UI5_PIN (a commit SHA)   what the transpiled backend and the e2e smoke
 *                              run against. Moved weekly by bump-a2ui5.
 *   the abaplint configs       the framework's MAIN branch: does the corpus
 *                              compile against the current framework.
 *   e2e-nightly                main tip, unpinned, as the upstream canary.
 *
 * The middle one carried a RELEASE TAG until 2026-08-31. That answered
 * "does the corpus compile for a reader who installed the release" — but it
 * also coupled every corpus merge that uses new framework API to a framework
 * RELEASE, and the maintainer's release cadence is monthly while merges land
 * daily (decided 2026-08-31, the hash_* API wave: 23 by-design reds for up
 * to a month were the alternative). So the syntax builds now resolve main —
 * merges gate on the framework as it IS — and what a port needs beyond the
 * latest release stays documented where it always was, in the sidecar prose
 * ("needs abap2UI5 newer than x.y.z"). abaplint cannot be given the
 * A2UI5_PIN SHA instead: `"branch"` feeds `git clone --branch`, which takes
 * a branch or a tag and never a commit — so main is the closest checkable
 * statement, and a framework change on main that reddens the corpus
 * overnight is accepted as exactly the canary signal e2e-nightly already
 * provides.
 *
 * Policy:
 *   1. A2UI5_PIN must be a single well-formed 40-hex commit SHA (the
 *      ancestor-of-main check needs the network and stays with the bump
 *      workflow — not verified here).
 *   2. An abaplint config's abap2UI5 dependency entry carries
 *      `"branch": "main"` — explicit, so a feature-branch re-point that
 *      survives a merge still fails here. ONE allowlisted exception:
 *      `.github/abaplint/abap_702.jsonc` needs `"branch": "702"`, because the
 *      702 build must resolve the framework against its downported branch
 *      (the framework's own auto_downport rebuilds it from main; main itself
 *      is not v702-parseable).
 *   3. Never two `"branch"` keys in one dependency entry — duplicate keys
 *      are exactly the silent-shadowing trap above.
 *   4. Neither ui5/properties.json nor ui5/descriptions.json is OLDER than
 *      ui5/universe.json — the second version pairing in this repository, and
 *      the one generate-result.yaml warns about in prose without anything
 *      checking it. All three come from ONE OpenUI5 checkout and answer three
 *      questions about the same release: the universe says which release the
 *      sample set was harvested from, the property snapshot answers `@since`,
 *      the description snapshot answers what a sample demonstrates.
 *      A property snapshot behind the universe has no `@since` for the
 *      controls introduced in between, so scopeOf reads them as in scope and a
 *      port gets scaffolded for a control the 1.71 floor could never render
 *      (sap.f.HeroBanner, @1.152, is the case that named this). A DESCRIPTION
 *      snapshot behind the universe is worse-natured: `check:summary` fails
 *      HARD on a port that matches no source (deliberately — the point is that
 *      a new undescribed sample gets noticed), so the corpus can reach a state
 *      only a manual refresh repairs. It was six weeks and one minor release
 *      behind when this rule was extended, and generate-result.yaml refreshed
 *      the other two weekly without ever touching it.
 *      Compared on major.minor: both snapshots are built from an OpenUI5
 *      master checkout and call themselves `-SNAPSHOT`, the same release line.
 *   5. The UI5 RUNTIME pins are one exact version, and it is the version the
 *      linter judges against. Three things have to agree for `view_gates` to
 *      hold a single opinion: the `@openui5/*` packages the render harness
 *      loads the runtime from, the `@sapui5/*` packages `scope-of.mjs` reads
 *      `@since` out of, and `@abap2ui5/linter`'s own `data/properties.json`,
 *      which is what the property gate calls "exists". When they disagree the
 *      failure is not a version verdict a `POST_171` deviation can excuse: a
 *      member released after the metadata is `unknown-property` ("typo?") plus
 *      a render load failure, and the only way out is a `property_gate` skip.
 *      App 611 carries exactly that pair today.
 *      Exact pins, not ranges: half of these carried `^1.151.0`, so a fresh
 *      `npm install` the day 1.152 publishes would move the render harness's
 *      runtime — and with it which skips are stale — without a diff. The
 *      linter's metadata version cannot move that way (it ships inside the
 *      package), so a caret here is a promise that only one side can keep.
 *      `ui5/universe.json` is deliberately NOT part of the equality: it is
 *      harvested from an OpenUI5 CHECKOUT and legitimately runs ahead of what
 *      npm has published. A gap there is reported as a note, because it is
 *      the state that forces the skips above.
 *   6. Prose AGREES with the pin. A sentence that asserts a commit SHA IS the
 *      pin — in a markdown document or in a `meta/` sidecar's long-form text —
 *      must name A2UI5_PIN's actual value. Nothing checked this, and
 *      `bump-a2ui5.yaml` moves the pin on a schedule: the 2026-08-28 bump to
 *      `2567ee10` left SEVEN documents saying the pin was still `bf92a79c`,
 *      six of them the sidecars of ports that were "blocked on the pin" and
 *      had not been for hours. That is the same failure mode
 *      `check-prose-names.mjs` exists for one noun over, so it reads the same
 *      two scopes: the prose files, and every sidecar's `deviations[].what` /
 *      `audit.note` / `checked.note` / skip `reason`.
 *      Only an ASSERTION is judged — "A2UI5_PIN is <sha>", "the pin moved to
 *      <sha>", "the pin caught up (<sha>)". A past-tense sentence is HISTORY
 *      and is left alone ("A2UI5_PIN sat at bf92a79c while main moved 61
 *      commits" is a true record of a run that happened), exactly as the
 *      journal is: `docs/history.md` is out of scope for the same reason
 *      check-prose-names leaves it out.
 *
 * A deliberate, temporary feature-branch re-point (the documented re-pin
 * flow) must therefore edit ALLOWED_BRANCHES below in the same change — the
 * temporary state then shows in the diff and cannot survive a merge unseen.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-pins.mjs               (offline, exit 1)
