/*
 * Generates the in-system overview app src/z2ui5_cl_smpc_app_000.clas.*
 * — an abap2UI5 app that lists every ported sample as one row of a table with
 * columns: Module, Control (-> OpenUI5 API), Sample (name -> OpenUI5 repo
 * source, ↗ -> live OpenUI5 fullscreen sample), abap2UI5 (class name ->
 * generated class on GitHub, ↗ -> starts the app) and Note (green check when
 * live-verified; orange 1.71+ badge when the port keeps members newer than
 * UI5 1.71; hint button opens the deviations popup). Every link opens in
 * a NEW browser tab (target="_blank"; the ↗ start link uses ?app_start=).
 * Reads everything from the meta/ sidecars (the source of truth for sample,
 * entity, checked and deviations - the three `"` header lines a port carries,
 * @keywords / @summary / @origin, are themselves generated from the sidecar
 * and the DESCRIPT, so the sidecar stays the one source).
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/generate-overview.mjs
 *       node scripts/generate-overview.mjs --update-entities
 *         (rebuilds ui5/openui5-entities.json from the installed @openui5
 *          sources - needs node_modules; see the oracle comment below)
