/*
 * generate-keywords — give every port a `" @keywords` line, derived.
 *
 * These 431 classes carried nothing: no keyword line, no summary, and (bar 15
 * of them) no ABAP Doc either. A port was reachable by its class name -
 * z2ui5_cl_smpc_app_003 - and by nothing else. Somebody looking for "how do I
 * do breadcrumbs" found it only by knowing the number, and so did an agent.
 *
 * Nothing here is invented, and that is the point. Every term comes from data
 * already in the repository, out of three places that describe the same port
 * from different angles:
 *
 *   meta/<class>.json `entity`   sap.m.Breadcrumbs -> `breadcrumbs`, `sap.m`
 *                                the UI5 control this port is ABOUT, and its
 *                                library. The single most likely search term.
 *   the class DESCRIPT           "sap.m.Breadcrumbs - breadcrumb trail with
 *                                separator" -> `breadcrumb trail separator`.
 *                                The demo kit's own words for what it shows,
 *                                truncated at 60 characters but real.
 *   the ele( ) / tag( ) chain    Breadcrumbs, HBox, Label, Link, Select -
 *                                what the port actually BUILDS, which is what
 *                                somebody searching for "link inside a select"
 *                                is looking for.
 *
 * Written as generated-and-committed rather than resolved at read time: the
 * line has to be IN the class, because a class file is what a search engine
 * serves, what abapGit pulls into the system and what an agent reads. That is
 * the whole argument for the class over the sidecar, and it would be undone by
 * keeping the terms in a sidecar and computing them on demand.
 *
 *   node scripts/generate-keywords.mjs          write the lines
 *   node scripts/generate-keywords.mjs --check  fail if a line is missing or
 *                                               out of date (CI runs this)
