# abap2UI5 — sample coverage

One row per UI5 demo kit sample. **Control** links to the OpenUI5 API,
**Since** is the version the control was introduced, **Deprecated**
carries the deprecation version and the replacement hint from the
release's `api.json` (empty = not deprecated), **Sample** links the
source in the [OpenUI5 repository](https://github.com/SAP/openui5) and
its ↗ opens the live fullscreen sample, **ABAP** is the generated class.
`—` = in scope, not ported yet — those rows are the backlog.
`⊘` = in scope and deliberately **reserved**: the sample belongs to the
hold-out set (`ui5/holdout.json`) that measures the generator, so it is
kept unported on purpose and is not part of the backlog — see the
[README](README.md#coverage).
`✗` = **out of scope**: the control is deprecated (not legacy-free ready),
or the sample is not an app
view at all (UI5 test infrastructure, Component routing, view-templating and
XMLComposite authoring demos — `ui5/scope-nonapp.json`) — these samples are
listed for completeness but are not ported. A **⁺** after the class marks ports
that keep a control or members newer than UI5 1.71 for 1:1 fidelity (declared as
POST_171 in the sidecar) — they need a correspondingly recent UI5.
See the [README](README.md#coverage) for the per-module coverage summary.

_Control metadata (Since, deprecation) from the OpenUI5 **1.152.0** `api.json`._
