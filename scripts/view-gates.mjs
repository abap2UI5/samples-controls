 * view-gates — the corpus side of abap2UI5-linter.
 *
 * The gates themselves live in @abap2ui5/linter, which was extracted from the
 * three scripts this replaces (property-check, structure-lint, render-smoke):
 * the view is reconstructed from the builder calls, every control and member
 * resolved against the UI5 metadata snapshot, the builder tree checked for
 * structural defects, and the whole thing rendered with a real XMLView.create
 * in headless Chromium against the OpenUI5 runtime.
 *
 * What stays here is the corpus POLICY - the part that is about ai-demokit
 * and not about abap2UI5 views in general:
 *
 *   - which ports are checked: the meta/ sidecars, not a directory walk
 *   - a post-1.71 member is allowed when a deviation NAMES it (AGENTS §5):
 *     1:1 fidelity wins, but the deviation has to be written down
 *   - a port may declare `render_smoke.skip` with a reason, and that skip is
 *     verified against the actual render: the moment the view renders clean
 *     the skip is stale and FAILS, so a skip can never quietly rot
 *   - findings the linter has learned since (accessibility, unhandled events,
 *     …) are reported as advisories rather than gating the corpus
 *
 *   node scripts/view-gates.mjs               advisory report
 *   node scripts/view-gates.mjs --strict      exit 1 on any violation
 *   node scripts/view-gates.mjs --no-render   the static gates only (no browser)
 *   node scripts/view-gates.mjs --only 164    one port

  //            reaches the view, because the builder guards it
  //            (`IF state IS NOT INITIAL.`) - the default dialog is the one
  //            the original builds without a state.
  //   app 445  sap.m.Text.wrappingType     an EXPRESSION binding, resolved in
  //            the client: `{= … ? 'Hyphenated' : 'Normal' }`. Both arms are
  //            sap.m.WrappingType, and switching the property live is what the
  //            sample demonstrates - a statically resolvable value would mean
  //            deleting the subject.
  //   app 452  sap.m.MessageStrip.colorSet  the same shape:
  //            `{= … ? 'ColorSet1' : 'ColorSet2' }`, both in
  //            sap.m.MessageStripColorSet.
  //   app 454  sap.m.TableSelectDialog.initialFocus  a `COND #( WHEN growing
  //            = abap_true THEN `SearchField` ELSE `List` )`; both arms are
  //            literal and both are the enum. The property is also @since
  //            1.117, which its POST_171 already declares.
