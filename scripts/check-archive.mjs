/*
 * check-archive — every file a sample's manifest lists is actually archived.
 *
 * WHY: AGENTS.md section 4 says archive EVERYTHING the sample's manifest.json
 * lists under `sap.ui5 > config > sample > files`, "or fidelity cannot be
 * verified offline". Nothing checked it, and the failure mode is silent in the
 * worst way: a port is re-read against an archive that LOOKS complete, the
 * missing file is the one carrying the behaviour, and the re-read comes back
 * clean. `ui5/sap.ui.layout/GridAutoFlow/` was exactly that on 2026-08-23 —
 * its controller's only dependency, `RevealGrid/RevealGrid.js`, was absent
 * while the sidecar claimed "closing the AGENTS section 4 archive gap".
 *
 * Three things declare a file, and the gate has to read all three - the CSS of
 * app 157's sample was missing for a month because only the first was checked:
 *
 *   manifest `sample.files`      the sample's own file list.
 *   manifest `resources.css`     how a sample normally declares a stylesheet
 *                                (60 of them do).
 *   Component.js `includes`      the OLD form, a UIComponent metadata key.
 *                                One sample in 622 still uses it, and that is
 *                                exactly the one whose sheet went missing.
 *
 * Two scopes, deliberately not the same severity:
 *
 *   inside the sample folder   an ERROR. This is the sample's own material;
 *                              if it is missing, the archive is incomplete
 *                              and nobody can tell by looking.
 *   `../<Shared*>/...`         REPORTED, never an error. AGENTS section 4
 *                              carries an explicit exception for these: the
 *                              uxap manifests OVER-LIST, naming the whole
 *                              `../SharedBlocks/` set regardless of what the
 *                              view instantiates, and structural-diff resolves
 *                              manifest-listed `../<OtherSample>/*.view.xml`,
 *                              so archiving them would make it demand phantom
 *                              controls from correct ports. They are counted
 *                              here so the exception stays visible and its
 *                              size is known — not so someone backfills it.
 *
 * `scripts/archive-absent.json` allowlists files that are listed upstream but
 * genuinely not fetchable (binaries the corpus does not archive, manifest
 * entries the demo kit never served). Each entry carries a reason, and an
 * entry whose file DOES exist is an error — an allowlist that outlives its
 * gap is how the next one hides.
