 *   - HARD: every module must belong to a port sidecar, to the overview app or

 *     leftover and would never run again. The demo apps are sidecar-less by

 *     that does name them, ui5/demoapps.json's `ports` block; e2e-smoke reads
 *     the same list to decide what to boot.
 *   - HARD: every module must be able to FAIL. A module that only reads the
 *     DOM and console.logs it passes whatever the port does, and the whole
 *     coverage bookkeeping then counts the port as verified: the LIVE_TEST gap
 *     below reads 0, the README lists it among the covered classes, and a
 *     green nightly says nothing about it. Three such recon scripts (301, 351,
 *     353) sat in here from the session that used them to learn the DOM and
 *     were never rewritten — found 2026-08-21, and cheap to detect, because a
 *     module that can fail always says so somewhere: `expect(`, a `throw`, a
 *     `waitFor…` (Playwright's own waits reject on timeout), or an import from
 *     lib-e2e, whose helpers all throw.
 *   - ADVISORY: interaction COVERAGE, reported over the port set and split by
 *     the status ladder.
 *     This advisory used to be based on the LIVE_TEST backlog — every port
 *     with an open LIVE_TEST deviation should have a module, that being the
 *     automated close path (STATUS.md). It was right while the backlog had
 *     122 entries and it became structurally DEAD when the backlog reached 0
 *     on 2026-08-26: the source list is empty, so the advisory reports
 *     nothing, forever, no matter how the real debt moves. What it was
 *     standing in for is still there — 289 of 622 ports (46%) have no
 *     meta/interactions/<class>.mjs — and it is worst exactly where a reader
 *     would least expect it, because the ladder and the coverage run in
 *     OPPOSITE directions: 42 of 59 `checked` ports and 192 of 355 `reviewed`
 *     ones have no module, against 55 of 208 `generated`. The rungs that
 *     claim the most verification carry the least automated proof of it, and
 *     a `checked` port is the one whose live check a code change silently
 *     invalidates (AGENTS §10).
 *     Still an ADVISORY, deliberately: 289 gaps cannot become a hard gate
 *     without failing every batch commit until they are closed, and the
 *     directory README is explicit that it is grown port by port. AGENTS does
 *     not argue for more — it asks for the debt to be visible. So the count is
