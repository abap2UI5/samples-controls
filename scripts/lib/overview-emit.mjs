" @summary Every ported demo kit sample in one searchable, sortable table - control, sample, class and rating - linking to the OpenUI5 original and starting the port in the system.
"! Generated overview app - lists every abap2UI5 api sample app in a table.
"! The search field filters the table on the client (binding_call Contains, no
"! round-trip); its query is two-way bound (search_query), so it survives a
"! round-trip or an app state restore (draft) and view_display re-applies the
"! filter via follow_up_action.
"! The title carries the ported-app count in parentheses. The sortable Since
"! column (next to Control) shows the UI5 release the CONTROL appeared in (from
"! ui5/universe.json; blank when older than tracking / since forever). It is
"! coloured orange (ObjectStatus Warning) when newer than UI5 1.71; a deprecated
"! control's name is struck through (FormattedText htmlText, so the strikethrough
"! can vary per row). There is no per-SAMPLE Since column - whether a sample needs
"! a release newer than 1.71 is carried by the Hide-newer-than-1.71 filter and
"! spelled out in the Open column's info popover.
"! The page has no header of its own: render_header( ) puts a Bar into its
"! customHeader, with the back button and the title on the left and the SHARED
"! OVERVIEW HEADER of the abap2UI5 family on the right - one core:Icon per
"! sample repository, then, set apart by a wider margin (NOT a separator
"! control - a block-level child breaks the row on UI5 1.71, see
"! render_header( )), the documentation and this
"! repository, each explaining itself in its tooltip. Every repository is
"! installed on its own, so each icon decides for itself - class_installed( )
"! instantiates the target class, an installed overview app is entered with
"! nav_app_call( ) (the back button returns), and a missing one opens a popover
"! saying it has to be installed first, with the link to its repository. There
"! are two states and no more: active, and the ONE inactive icon - this
"! repository's own entry, greyed out with no press, so the row reads the same
"! in all three overviews. Keep it in sync with the copies in abap2UI5/samples
"! and abap2UI5/samples-stack.
"! Three header checkboxes (default all on) filter the table
"! entirely on the client via each row's visible expression: Hide non-OpenUI5,
"! Hide newer than 1.71 (2020), Hide deprecated (the ui5_only flag behind the
"! first one has no column of its own - the badge column was dropped 2026-07-29).
"! A Shell switch toggles the
"! sap.m.Shell letterboxing (appWidthLimited), client-side. Navigation lives in
"! the trailing Open column, which carries three buttons, each anchored to its
"! own runtime id. The chain-link one opens the LINKS popover: four full-width
"! Transparent Buttons - Control API Reference, Sample Link, Sample Source Code,
"! abap2UI5 Source Code, each opening its target in a new tab through the
"! URLHELPER REDIRECT frontend action (a Button carries no href, and open_new_tab
"! is same-origin only). The second starts
"! this abap2UI5 app directly in a new tab (open_new_tab; the start URL is
"! same-origin, so it passes isValidRedirectURL) - the overview stays open in its
"! own tab. The trailing information one opens the INFO popover with the
"! port's generation notes - live-check status, the members that need a release
"! newer than 1.71, and the deviation list as a bullet list; it renders only on a
"! row that carries at least one of the three.
"! The Rating column is a 1-5 "by feel" score of
"! how much attention a port deserves (not coloured): app complexity, how heavily
"! it was reworked/corrected (IMPROVISED/DROPPED_171/SUBSET_DATA/NOTE), whether it
"! was reviewed/discussed (it carries a checked block), and how important a live
"! re-test is (pending LIVE_TESTs, roundtrip-free wiring, popups, needs-newer-UI5);
"! 1 = simple faithful 1:1, 5 = complex/reworked/worth a close look. Sort it
"! descending to surface the samples worth a closer manual look.
"! Both popovers are backend round-trips, but the row's press carries only its
"! CLASS: the generation notes, the live-check text and the four reference URLs
"! are looked up from the catalog in on_event, so they never enter the bound
"! model. Only bound columns are public state, which keeps the persisted draft
"! (and the model JSON of every render) small - a transpiled runtime such as
"! the playground re-parses that draft on every round-trip.
"! The search field above the table filters all rows by a
"! substring over the text columns (module, control, since, sample,
"! class) only, and each sortable column header carries ascending/
"! descending sort icons - both run entirely on the frontend
"! (cs_event-binding_call via follow_up_action, no server round-trip). Do not edit
