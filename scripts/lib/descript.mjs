/* The class DESCRIPT, read the way an abapGit sidecar actually stores it.
 *
 * `<DESCRIPT>` is XML, so a description containing an apostrophe is on disk as
 *
 *   <DESCRIPT>sap.m.FacetFilter - This is a &apos;Light&apos; version of the F</DESCRIPT>
 *
 * Two generators read that field, both with a bare `match(/<DESCRIPT>…/)` and
 * neither unescaping, so `&apos;Light&apos;` reached the generated `@keywords`
 * line of z2ui5_cl_smpc_app_022 as the single token `aposlightapos` — the
 * search term `light` did not find the port that is ABOUT the light version.
 * Silent, because a keyword line is generated and never read by a person.
 *
 * abap2UI5/samples and abap2UI5/samples-stack both unescape; this repository
 * was the one that did not. It is one function rather than one per generator
 * for the obvious reason: the bug was in the copy, not in the idea.
