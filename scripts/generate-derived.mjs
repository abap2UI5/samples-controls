/*
 * generate-derived — catalogue-derived.json, what the LINTER knows about each
 * port, beside what catalogue.json says the tree holds.
 *
 * Two questions this corpus is actually asked cannot be answered from the
 * sidecars, and so not from catalogue.json either:
 *
 *   "my system runs UI5 1.84 — which of these 636 ports will render on it?"
 *   "which ports use sap.m.Table at all, not just the one filed under it?"
 *
 * A port's `entity` is the ONE control the demo kit sample is about, so a port
 * that merely uses a Table inside a page about something else is invisible to
 * it; and the UI5 release a port needs is written nowhere — the POST_171
 * deviations name it in prose ("exists only since UI5 1.77"), which is a
 * sentence for a human, not a filter.
 *
 * Both come out of @abap2ui5/linter, which already reconstructs the view a
 * builder chain produces and resolves every control and member against the UI5
 * metadata snapshot — the same pass view-gates runs, render gate off (it needs
 * a browser and answers a different question: does the view load). It is asked
 * for two things it computes anyway:
 *
 *   stats.types            every control the port BUILDS, with occurrences
 *   `*-too-new` findings   every control/member/aggregation/enum value/icon
 *                          newer than the 1.71 floor, each carrying `since`
 *
 * The highest of those `since` values IS the port's minimum UI5 release, and
 * the floor itself when there are none. That is the same number view-gates
 * gates on and the sidecars declare in prose, derived rather than restated, so
 * this file cannot drift from the corpus.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SECOND FILE. Everything a port carries that is committed fact —
 * title, summary, keywords, sample, entity, library, status, deviations — is
 * in catalogue.json already, and that file is generated offline and
 * dependency-free on purpose. Repeating those eight fields here would mean 636
 * ports written twice, two ~500 KB files diffing on every port PR, and a
 * second place for them to be wrong. So this one carries ONLY the derived
 * facts, keyed by `class`: a consumer joins the two on that key. They are
 * generated from one scan of one tree in one `npm run gates`, so they cannot
 * disagree about which ports exist.
 *
 * COMMITTED, unlike the apps.json that used to feed this repository's own
 * Pages site. That site is gone; the catalogue that replaced it is published
 * from the playground and builds its index at deploy time by fetching this
 * file, and raw.githubusercontent.com serves committed files only.
 *
 *   node scripts/generate-derived.mjs          write catalogue-derived.json
 *   node scripts/generate-derived.mjs --check  fail if it is stale (CI)
 *   node scripts/generate-derived.mjs --quiet  no per-port progress counter
